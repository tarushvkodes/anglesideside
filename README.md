# ASS Triangle Visualization

This project demonstrates why the Angle-Side-Side (ASS) condition does not work for proving triangle congruence. The visualization shows two triangles that share the same ASS condition but are not congruent.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the webpage.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the webpage.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for the triangle visualization.

## How to Run

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. The visualization will be displayed on the canvas element.

## Explanation

The ASS condition does not guarantee triangle congruence because it can produce two different triangles. The visualization shows two triangles with the same angle and side lengths, but they are not congruent. This demonstrates the ambiguity of the ASS condition, as it can result in two different triangles that do not overlap. Therefore, ASS is not a valid criterion for proving triangle congruence.
