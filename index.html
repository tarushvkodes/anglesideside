    <h1>Why Angle-Side-Side (ASS) Does Not Work for Triangle Congruence</h1>
    <p>The ASS condition does not guarantee triangle congruence because it can produce two different triangles. This visualization demonstrates why.</p>
    <canvas id="triangleCanvas" width="600" height="400"></canvas>
    <p>The visualization above shows two triangles that share the same Angle-Side-Side (ASS) condition. The red and blue triangles have the same angle and side lengths, but they are not congruent. This demonstrates the ambiguity of the ASS condition, as it can result in two different triangles that do not overlap. Therefore, ASS is not a valid criterion for proving triangle congruence.</p>
